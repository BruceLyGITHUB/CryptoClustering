# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Instructions

- Rename the Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb file as Crypto_Clustering.ipynb.

- Load the crypto_market_data.csv into a DataFrame.

- Get the summary statistics and plot the data to see what the data looks like before proceeding.

## Prepare the Data

- Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

- Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.
